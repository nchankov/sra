# SRA Locations plugin

Plugin which monitors locations for changed files. The plugin is useful if there is a risk of files to be changed on the 
certain locations. For example if there is a wordpress installation and you want to monitor of any php files that have 
changed

To add a new location to monitor:

- **add.sh** - add a new location. Follow the instructions in the script to add an existing directory
- **remove.sh** - remove a location already in the monitor (just type the location you want to remove)
- **list.sh** - see the list of monitored locations
